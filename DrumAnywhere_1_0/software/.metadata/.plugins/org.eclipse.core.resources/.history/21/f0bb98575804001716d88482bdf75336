 * Code here is meant to be copied into the actual project to be used for testing.
 * This is due to the need of various things to be initialized for these methods to work
 */

 * it will first initialize the sd card interface along with the EFSL library

 * 1 is returned if all tests pass
 * -1 is returned if spi initializing fails
 * -2 is returned if file fails to open
 * -3 is returned if the file fails to read
